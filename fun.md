# weekend kentucky fun

[West Sixth Brewery](http://www.westsixth.com/)
One of our favorite places in town. Not only do they have amazing local beer (famous for their IPA), Rand's favorite soft pretzels from [Sunrise Bakery](http://valotta.com/), and delicious food trucks set up outside each evening, but they are a community that gives back, houses artists (including [Cricket Press](http://www.cricket-press.com/) who designed and printed our awesome wedding invitations), [roller derby girls](http://rocknrollergirls.com/), a [local bicyle shop](http://thebrokespoke.org/). Anne Dean also teaches a free community [yoga](http://www.facebook.com/WestSixthYoga) class in the beer garden every Wednesday!


[Sidebar Grill](http://www.facebook.com/sidebar.grill)
Our favorite tiny dive bar with amazing black bean burgers and sweet potato fries. And the ice cream! Anne Dean's friend Seana of [Pedal Sassy](http://www.facebook.com/PedalSassy?fref=ts) makes the best ice cream (with alcohol) and it is served here. Flavors rotate each week.


[Table 310](http://www.table-three-ten.com/)
One of our favorite atmospheres for drinks before or after dinner, dinner, or just dessert. Make a reservation to be safe and you will not be disappointed. Blackboar dmenu changes weekly.


[The Village Idiot](http://www.lexingtonvillageidiot.com/)
Lexington's first gastropub. Ale-steamed mussels? Need we say more...


[Stella's Kentucky Deli](http://www.stellaskentuckydeli.com/)
Best lunch in town (close by [The Grey Goose](http://www.facebook.com/GreyGooseLex)  and [Nick Ryan's Saloon](http://nickryans.com/) -two other excellent lunch/dinner options)


[Mellow Mushroom Pizza](http://mellowmushroom.com/store/lexington)
We LOVE pizza.


[Alfalfa](http://www.alfalfarestaurant.com/)
Amazing for brunch!


[Doodles](http://www.doodlesrestaurant.com/)
Say yes to an awesome breakfast. Plus they have beignets.


[Third Street Stuff Coffee](http://www.yelp.com/biz/third-st-stuff-lexington)
Coffee, breakfast, lunch-YUM


For more beer (we like good beer), head to another local brewery [Country Boy Brewing](http://www.facebook.com/CountryBoyBrewing), [The Beer Trappe](http://www.thebeertrappe.com/) , or [Lexington Beerworks](http://lexingtonbeerworks.com/home/) (close to Gratz Park Inn)


For anyone willing to hop in a car to experience a little more Kentucky...


[Wallace Station](http://www.wallacestation.com/Wallace_Station_Deli_and_Bakery/Home.html)
This is a joint in the middle of beautiful KY horse country and has been featured in Garden & Gun and the Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.
It is worth the drive alone!


Horses and Bourbon

Get up early and head to [Keeneland](http://www.keeneland.com/discover/morning-workouts) racetrack to see eat breakfast at the Track Kitchen and to watch racehorses run their morning workouts. It is simply breathtaking!
Morning Workouts run from 6 am until 10 am.


Tour our [favorite bourbon distillery](http://www.woodfordreserve.com)! This is definitely worth the drive and the sample you receive at the end.


If you have time, check out other distilleries on the [Kentucky Bourbon Trail](http://kybourbontrail.com/)

# A Story of Distance and Love

## 647 Miles by Air, 797 by Car

The story of Anne Dean and Rand began a few years ago, out on the academic history conference circuit. They had the exact same job as senior acquisitions editors for different university presses, but they met because Rand (who is also a historian) was presenting a paper at the meeting that Anne Dean believed might be worth looking into as a possible book project. As a result, they met for about ten minutes during the conference. Rand was in a suit and tie, and rambled on about ambiguous ideas for a book; Anne Dean was in a dress and red cowboy boots, taking notes (or at least pretending to). While no book emerged, Rand did develop an immediate crush on the seemingly hip, smart, and completely enthralling Anne Dean. (He also learned, much to his mortification, that her first name was not “Anne.”) Meanwhile, Anne Dean had also developed a crush on this tall, mysterious, and seemingly aloof historian and editor named Rand. 

A year later, Anne Dean and Rand found themselves out for dinner and drinks with mutual friends, which led naturally to a wide-ranging conversation over dinner about the odd ways of academic authors. That led to drinks at a hotel bar, which led to them laughing hysterically about the history of their peculiar pets: the possible whereabouts of Anne Dean’s long-lost childhood pony Festus, and the strange and mysterious ways of Rand’s pet cockatiel, Audrey Hepbird. 

They quickly learned that they had a lot in common – same cars (VWs, of course), fans of the same indie bands, same taste in fiction, proud to be liberals in politics, into the same design ideas, both devoted fans of Wes Anderson movies, and so on. They also learned that they had some striking differences – Rand golfed, Anne Dean practiced yoga. (Rand has since taken yoga from Anne Dean and hopes to continue practicing. Anne Dean took one golf lesson from Rand and vowed to never to swing a club again.) 

After that conference, they said goodbye. Rand went home to Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Anne Dean returned to Lexington, Kentucky. Maybe things would have ended there if Rand had not then mailed Anne Dean a Festus-themed mix cd, and if Anne Dean had not then responded by mailing Rand an Audrey Hepbird-themed mix cd. A couple months later, they met in Boston at another history conference. Over dinners, drinks, lunches, exploring bookstores, getting lost in the snow, and going bowling, they literally became inseparable. (And just in case their bosses are reading, they also worked very hard during the day to acquire academic history books.) Then they said goodbye again. 

Anne Dean and Rand fell madly in love (how else can you explain that soon thereafter they started calling each other Anden and Randen?). Over the next couple of years, they made Delta Airlines a handsome profit flying back and forth over the 647 miles between to Lexington and Baton Rouge. They also became well acquainted with the 797 miles of interstate that separates them. They said goodbye a lot (like about once every two to four weeks over two years). It was not easy for either of them being so far apart, but they figured it had to work out, and it did! Along the way, Anne Dean and Rand had a wild array of marvelous adventures that neither of them will forget. They caught beads at Courier de Mardi Gras parades in rural Louisiana; toured bourbon distilleries in Kentucky (and sampled their delicious wares); wandered the back alleys of the French Quarter and found their favorite restaurant in Uptown New Orleans; cheered on the UK basketball team in Rupp Arena; gazed down upon Roanoke, Virginia from the Mill Mountain Star; got sunburned on beaches in Pensacola, Florida and Charleston, South Carolina; found a speakeasy in frigid Chicago; went hiking in the Tunica Hills of Mississippi; and luckiest of all, met all of you – their families and friends. 

This past New Year’s Eve, as fireworks exploded in the midnight sky over Lexington, Rand proposed to Anne Dean with an antique Art Nouveau engagement ring. Anne Dean said yes. (Her cats Splendor and Selah are still holding out hope that she will come to her senses.) 

They are fascinated with and thrilled about their future, and they feel incredibly privileged that you, their friends and family, will be with them to see their journey begin on September 28, 2013.

## GET ME TO KENTUCKY! (THIS IS A NEW PAGE-HEADER TITLE)

``INSERT MAP HERE``

### By air:

There are three good airport options:

-[LEX](http://www.bluegrassairport.com/), in Lexington  


-[SDF](http://www.flylouisville.com/), in Louisville


-[CVG](http://www.cvgairport.com/), in Northern Kentucky (Cincinnati)

[LEX](http://www.bluegrassairport.com/) is the closest airport but not always the most economical. [SDF](http://www.flylouisville.com/) and [CVG](http://cvgairport.com/)are both around an hour and fifteen minute drive to Lexington and typically have more options. After two-and-a-half years of traveling back and forth between Kentucky and Louisiana, we both know all of these airports well (especially LEX). Let us know if you need advice or have questions!

### By automobile:

Lexington literally sits at the intersection of two major interstates, I-64 (east, west) and I-75 (north, south). Our favorite people (you all) will be traveling from all over, so please let us know if we can help with the navigation!

- From the Lexington airport: turn left on Man O'War boulevard from the LEX exit. The first big intersection you come to is Versailles Road (pronounced VER-SAILS; we are Kentuckian, not French). Turn right on Versailles Road which will lead you directly into downtown Lexington. All three hotels that have room blocks for the wedding are within walking distance of each other downtown. 
 

- For Hyatt and Hilton lodgers (please see hotel details on GET A ROOM! page), stay on Versailles (practice saying it outloud again), it will eventually turn into High Street (almost every major road in Lexington has at LEAST three names). High Street happens when the road becomes one-way. Turn left on North Broadway and you will see the Hyatt on your left. Drive one more block and the Hilton will be on your right (turn right on Vine Street). 


- For Gratz Park Inn lodgers, make the same left on North Broadway, but drive a couple more blocks and turn right on Short Street (one-way). You will see a few of our favorite restaurants and then turn left on North Limestone (one-way). Drive a couple more blocks and you will see Gratz Park Inn signs on your left. Turn left on West Second Street and the hotel will be directly on your left. 


## GET A ROOM! (THIS IS A NEW PAGE-HEADER TITLE)

We have blocked off rooms at three hotels in downtown Lexington. All three hotels are within walking distance of each other and we will add information soon about shuttling to the various venues. The meeting place hotel will be the Hilton on Vine Street. 


Rooms have been reserved under Watkins/Dotson Wedding for September 27 and September 28. If you plan on arriving earlier or staying later (yay!), we have been told that the same discounted rate will be applied if rooms are available. 
Please book before August 27th to guarantee the group rate. 

Here are links to the hotels  (Hilton and Hyatt can be booked directly from below links, Gratz Park will need to be called for reservations.)

[HYATT](https://resweb.passkey.com/Resweb.do?mode=welcome_ei_new&eventID=10614514)


[GRATZ PARK INN](http://www.gratzparkinn.com/) (historic boutique inn)
A handful of rooms and suites have been held under Watkins/Dotson wedding
Contact Will Smith or the front desk to make reservations

Please let us know if you have trouble making any of these arrangements. The key is to book your room(s)early! 

## The Weekend! (THIS IS A NEW PAGE-HEADER TITLE)

Both the ceremony and reception will take place at Anne Dean's grandparents' property nestled amongst beautiful horse country on Old Richmond Road. 

The adults-only (with the exception of family members) ceremony and reception will take place on the lawn (weather permitting), so keep that in mind as you choose your attire and, more importantly, your dancing shoes for the evening.
MORE DETAILS regarding the venue TO COME.

It is super important to us that you enjoy yourselves while in the Bluegrass. Below please find some of our favorites if you need ideas:

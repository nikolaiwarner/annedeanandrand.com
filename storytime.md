## A Story of Distance and Love
## 647 Miles by Air, 797 by Car

The story of Anne Dean and Rand began a few years ago, out on the academic history conference circuit. They had the exact same job as senior acquisitions editors for different university presses, but they met because Rand (who is also a historian) was presenting a paper at the meeting that Anne Dean believed might be worth looking into as a possible book project. As a result, they met for about ten minutes during the conference. Rand was in a suit and tie, and rambled on about ambiguous ideas for a book; Anne Dean was in a dress and red cowboy boots, taking notes (or at least pretending to). While no book emerged, Rand did develop an immediate crush on the seemingly hip, smart, and completely enthralling Anne Dean. (He also learned, much to his mortification, that her first name was not “Anne.”) Meanwhile, Anne Dean had also developed a crush on this tall, mysterious, and seemingly aloof historian and editor named Rand.

A year later, Anne Dean and Rand found themselves out for dinner and drinks with mutual friends, which led naturally to a wide-ranging conversation over dinner about the odd ways of academic authors. That led to drinks at a hotel bar, which led to them laughing hysterically about the history of their peculiar pets: the possible whereabouts of Anne Dean’s long-lost childhood pony Festus, and the strange and mysterious ways of Rand’s pet cockatiel, Audrey Hepbird.

They quickly learned that they had a lot in common – same cars (VWs, of course), fans of the same indie bands, same taste in fiction, proud to be liberals in politics, into the same design ideas, both devoted fans of Wes Anderson movies, and so on. They also learned that they had some striking differences – Rand golfed, Anne Dean practiced yoga. (Rand has since taken yoga from Anne Dean and hopes to continue practicing. Anne Dean took one golf lesson from Rand and vowed to never swing a club again.)

After that conference, they said goodbye. Rand went home to Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Anne Dean returned to Lexington, Kentucky. Maybe things would have ended there if Rand had not then mailed Anne Dean a Festus-themed mix cd, and if Anne Dean had not then responded by mailing Rand an Audrey Hepbird-themed mix cd. A couple months later, they met in Boston at another history conference. Over dinners, drinks, lunches, exploring bookstores, getting lost in the snow, and going bowling, they literally became inseparable. (And just in case their bosses are reading, they also worked very hard during the day to acquire academic history books.) Then they said goodbye again.

Anne Dean and Rand fell madly in love (how else can you explain that soon thereafter they started calling each other Anden and Randen?). Over the next couple of years, they made Delta Airlines a handsome profit flying back and forth over the 647 miles between to Lexington and Baton Rouge. They also became well acquainted with the 797 miles of interstate that separates them. They said goodbye a lot (like about once every two to four weeks over two years). It was not easy for either of them being so far apart, but they figured it had to work out, and it did! Along the way, Anne Dean and Rand had a wild array of marvelous adventures that neither of them will forget. They caught beads at Courier de Mardi Gras parades in rural Louisiana; toured bourbon distilleries in Kentucky (and sampled their delicious wares); wandered the back alleys of the French Quarter and found their favorite restaurant in Uptown New Orleans; cheered on the UK basketball team in Rupp Arena; gazed down upon Roanoke, Virginia from the Mill Mountain Star; got sunburned on beaches in Pensacola, Florida and Charleston, South Carolina; found a speakeasy in frigid Chicago; went hiking in the Tunica Hills of Mississippi; and luckiest of all, met all of you – their families and friends.

This past New Year’s Eve, as fireworks exploded in the midnight sky over Lexington, Rand proposed to Anne Dean with an antique Art Nouveau engagement ring. Anne Dean said yes. (Her cats Splendor and Selah are still holding out hope that she will come to her senses.)

They are fascinated with and thrilled about their future, and they feel incredibly privileged that you, their friends and family, will be with them to see their journey begin on September 28, 2013.

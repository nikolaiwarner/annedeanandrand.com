# the weekend

Both the ceremony and reception will take place at Anne Dean's grandparents' property Whitehall, which is nestled amongst beautiful horse country on Old Richmond Road.

The adults-only (with the exception of family members) ceremony and reception will be held on the lawn (the weather WILL be beautiful), so keep that in mind as you choose your attire and, more importantly, your dancing shoes for the evening.

**Stay tuned for more details about the weekend, including transportation and parking as well as reliable chilcare options for those in need.


## a brief history of Whitehall

### Whitehall (circa 1848)

In 1848, Presbyterian Minister Joseph J. Bullock, the preacher of nearby Walnut Hill Church, established a school for girls on the grounds of the sanctuary. The academy, known then as “Bullock’s Female School,” opened in 1849 with six instructors and an enrollment of 120 students. Many of the girls attending classes boarded at the school, residing primarily in the dorm and principal’s residence that eventually became known as Whitehall.

The school, which later changed its name to Walnut Hill Female Seminary, attracted students from all over the South. According to a local newspaper, the student body “…included some of the most beautiful and accomplished women of the Southland, many of whom became prominent in social and educational circles afterwards.” The academy, like other nineteenth-century female schools, offered classes in rhetoric, elocution, Latin, moral philosophy, needlework, and music. It employed English and German gardeners to maintain the school grounds, which were planted in roses, grape arbors, and assorted flowers.

In May 1852, United States Senator and former Secretary of State and Speaker of the House, Henry Clay spoke at the school during the graduation ceremony of his granddaughter, Lucy Clay. (According to Dean family legend, Clay then spent the night at Whitehall.) In the ensuing decades, the school and Whitehall changed hands several times before closing during the Civil War. Although the school reopened after the war, it never completely rebounded and eventually closed for good. Soon thereafter, the academy burned to the ground.

The school’s dorm, Whitehall, survived the fire and eventually became a farm. Sometime in the early twentieth century, the property changed hands again with its new owners reopening it as the Whitehall Inn, a tourist resort. According to a postcard from the Inn, the place afforded “…all of the conveniences of a city hotel in the quiet atmosphere of the country.”

In the early 1950s, Anne Dean’s grandparents, Frank R. Dean, Jr. and his wife Martha V. Dean purchased Whitehall. Frank and Martha, otherwise known as “Papoo” and “Gaga” to Anne Dean and her cousins M.E. and Chad, lived at Whitehall with their two daughters, Debbi (Anne Dean's mom) and Melinda (Anne Dean’s aunt, otherwise known as Menya to AD). Frank and Martha later added on to the building behind the house to create a dog kennel where for the next several decades they raised, bred, groomed, showed, and loved on a variety of championship dogs, including Great Danes, Otterhounds, Poodles, Irish Wolfhounds (the tallest dogs in the world), and Norfolk Terriers. Today, Anne Dean's grandmother, Martha still lives in the house with her Irish Wolfhound, Peggy Sue.

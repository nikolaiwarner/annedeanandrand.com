# the weekend

Both the ceremony and reception will take place at Anne Dean's grandparents' property nestled amongst beautiful horse country on Old Richmond Road.

The adults-only (with the exception of family members) ceremony and reception will take place on the lawn (weather permitting), so keep that in mind as you choose your attire and, more importantly, your dancing shoes for the evening.
